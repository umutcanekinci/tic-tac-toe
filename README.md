# TicTacToe

This project contains a game developed with Python. TicTacToe is a pencil-and-paper game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The main goal of this project is to create a digital version of TicTacToe that can be played locally by two players.

Unfortunately, this project has joined the list of games I've left unfinished. I completed the menu, but perhaps I'll finish the game itself someday in the future.
